Role Name
=========

**Role Description: argocd_install**
As an Argo CD Installation , I developed an Ansible playbook to automate the installation and configuration of Argo CD. Here are the key tasks I accomplished:

1. **Cloning Official Argo CD Repo**:
   - I cloned the official Argo CD repository with a specific version to ensure consistency and reliability.

2. **Installation and Configuration**:
   - Using Ansible, I installed Argo CD on the target environment.
   - I configured it to use a LoadBalancer service type.
   - The service now listens on port 8063.

3. **Admin Password Retrieval**:
   - To retrieve the admin password securely, I implemented a wait statement.
   - The playbook waited until Argo CD was in a running state before fetching the password.

Overall, my role focused on streamlining Argo CD deployment, enhancing security, and ensuring smooth operations. ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
